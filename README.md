Currently copied straight from my copy. There are many things that need to be cleaned up, including some directories which are currently hard-coded in. Besides those this should work at least somewhat.

So what is it exactly?
This is a combination of an Asp.net MVC webserver, a game running on ImpactJS, and a HyperNEAT artificial intelligence library called SharpNEAT. The combination of these three culminate in an the AIs learning how to play a game of air hockey. The code that puts all of these together are in the AirServer project and the HyperNEATAirHockey project. There's currently very little documentation and some of it is wrong but that's basically what it's at for now!

 - Cheers
